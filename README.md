<!-- ===================== INTRO ===================== -->

<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Hesham Raza</h1>

<h3 align="center">
   UI/UX Designer | Front-End & CS Enthusiast | Aspiring Engineer | YI 2024 Qualifier | CBSE National Innovation Participant
</h3>

<p align="center">
 I believe technology should act as a support system, strengthening the real world experience rather than replacing it.

I am currently learning, experimenting, and building projects to strengthen my academic & technical foundation while preparing for future opportunities in engineering and technology.

During my academic journey, I led the team and contributed as a developer in designing and developing a student innovation project called Kisaan App, created for the CBSE Science Exhibition 2024 and Youth Ideathon (YI) 2024, where my team was selected among the Top 500 teams across India.
The project focused on supporting farmers through technology while respecting and complementing their real world agricultural experience.
